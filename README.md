Outlier methods are based on the assumption that noise pixels are significantly different from the surrounding pixels. This assumption allows us to identify noise pixels by comparing their intensity values to the intensity values of their neighbors.
There are three main types of outlier methods:
Thresholding
Adaptive filtering
Nearest-neighbor filtering
